# Test Plan & Definition of Done (DoD)

## Test Strategy Overview

### Test Pyramid Approach
1. **Unit Tests**: Core algorithms (interpolation, transforms, echo generation)
2. **Integration Tests**: Module interaction (StrokeManager + EchoManager)  
3. **Visual Tests**: Rendering correctness and echo positioning
4. **Performance Tests**: Frame rate stability and memory usage
5. **Device Tests**: Cross-platform compatibility (iPad, iPhone, Desktop)

## Functional Test Cases

### Drawing Input Tests
| Test Case | Input Method | Expected Behavior | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Basic Drawing | Mouse | Smooth continuous line | No gaps or jumps in stroke |
| Apple Pencil | iPad + Pencil | Pressure-sensitive line | Width varies with pressure |
| Touch Drawing | Finger on tablet | Normal line with fixed width | Consistent 2px width |
| Fast Movement | Rapid mouse drag | Interpolated smooth curve | No angular artifacts |
| Slow Drawing | Very slow movement | Detailed point capture | All micro-movements captured |

### Echo Generation Tests
| Test Case | Scenario | Expected Behavior | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Echo Timing | Draw for 1 second | ~10 echoes generated (100ms interval) | 9-11 echoes present |
| Echo Positioning | Single stroke | Echoes fade toward left-back | Each echo offset by (-8,-5) × k |
| Echo Scaling | Various strokes | Size decreases with depth | Each echo 96.5% of previous |
| Echo Alpha | Continuous drawing | Opacity fades correctly | Each echo 93% opacity of previous |
| Max Echo Count | Long drawing session | Count capped at 36 | Never exceeds echoCountMax |

### Rendering Quality Tests  
| Test Case | Scenario | Expected Behavior | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Layer Order | Overlapping echoes | Back-to-front rendering | Nearest echoes on top |
| Color Fidelity | Various stroke colors | Correct color preservation | No unwanted hue shifts |
| Blur Effect | Default settings | Subtle blur on distant echoes | Visible depth effect |
| Canvas Bounds | Drawing near edges | No rendering outside canvas | Clean edge clipping |
| Background | Multiple stroke colors | Black background maintained | No color bleeding |

### Performance Tests
| Test Case | Device | Duration | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Sustained Drawing | iPad Pro | 5 minutes | FPS > 45 throughout |
| Memory Stability | iPhone | 10 minutes | Memory growth < 10MB |
| Heavy Echo Load | Any device | 2 minutes | Auto-fallback engages smoothly |
| Recovery Test | Any device | Load → idle | Quality restored within 30s |

## User Experience Tests

### Interaction Flow Tests
1. **First Launch**
   - App loads within 3 seconds on 3G connection
   - Default settings provide immediate drawing capability
   - Help/tutorial is accessible but not intrusive

2. **Drawing Session**  
   - Drawing starts immediately on pointer down
   - Echo effect is visually apparent within 200ms
   - No lag between input and visual feedback
   - Settings changes apply in real-time

3. **Settings Exploration**
   - All sliders respond immediately to input
   - Preset buttons provide clear visual differences  
   - Reset button restores original state
   - Invalid settings are automatically corrected

### Accessibility Tests
1. **Motor Accessibility**
   - Minimum touch target: 44px × 44px for all controls
   - Sliders operable with switch control
   - Drawing possible with adaptive stylus

2. **Visual Accessibility**
   - High contrast mode support
   - Settings readable at 200% zoom
   - Color choices work for colorblind users

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Device Matrix
| Platform | Browser | Min Version | Test Status | Critical Features |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| iPad Pro | Safari | iOS 14 | ✓ Required | Apple Pencil, 60fps |
| iPad | Safari | iOS 13 | ✓ Required | Touch input, 45fps |
| iPhone 12+ | Safari | iOS 14 | ✓ Required | Touch input, responsive |
| iPhone 8+ | Safari | iOS 12 | ⚠ Nice-to-have | Basic functionality |
| Chrome | Desktop | v90+ | ✓ Required | Mouse input, 60fps |
| Firefox | Desktop | v88+ | ⚠ Nice-to-have | Mouse input, 45fps |

### Device-Specific Tests
1. **iPad Pro with Apple Pencil**
   - Pressure sensitivity works correctly
   - Tilt detection (if implemented)
   - Palm rejection functions
   - No double-touch issues

2. **iPhone Touch**
   - Single-finger drawing only  
   - No accidental multi-touch activation
   - Smooth performance in portrait/landscape
   - Settings panel usable on small screen

3. **Desktop Mouse/Trackpad**
   - Click-drag drawing functions
   - No right-click interference
   - Trackpad scrolling doesn't interfere
   - Settings panel full-sized

## Test Execution Strategy

### Pre-Release Testing Checklist
1. **Automated Testing** (5 minutes)
   - Run unit test suite
   - TypeScript compilation check  
   - Lint and format validation

2. **Manual Device Testing** (20 minutes)
   - iPad Pro + Apple Pencil: Full feature test
   - iPhone: Touch input and performance
   - Desktop Chrome: Mouse input and settings

3. **Performance Validation** (15 minutes)
   - 2-minute sustained drawing session per target device
   - Verify auto-fallback triggers at expected thresholds
   - Check memory growth remains within budget

4. **Visual Quality Check** (10 minutes)
   - Test all four presets on each device class
   - Verify echo positioning and fade effects
   - Screenshot comparison with reference images

### Release Criteria
All DoD checkboxes must be checked, and pre-release testing must pass on at least:
- 1 iPad device (Pro preferred)
- 1 iPhone device  
- 1 Desktop browser (Chrome or Safari)

### Known Limitations (Acceptable)
- Blur effects may be disabled on low-performance devices
- Very old devices (iOS < 13) may have degraded experience
- Firefox may have minor visual differences in echo rendering
- Offline functionality is not supported
